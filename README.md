# Seawi

Seawi is a CV builder using the power of go templates.

## Why

Why not? I used LaTeX for a long time to build my CV's and encouraged others to try it as well. But first timers are not really understanding LaTeX way of doing things, so to at least give a spark of the power of templating, I created this project.

## About the name

I like the word because it spelled like "CV" and turns out a name of a [book](https://www.amazon.com.tr/Seawi-Soleil-Levant-Naciente-Nascente/dp/1935084399) as well and the book's description says it means "Rising Sun" in Huron.

## How to use it

Fill `data.yml` with your values and run `make`. If everything goes right you should see `output.html` file in the project folder. This is your generated CV, enjoy.

I'm sorry non techies, this time I'm not adding .exe file to the repo.

## Testing

Run `go run test` and make sure everything is OK.
